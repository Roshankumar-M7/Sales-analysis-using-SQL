📊 Sales Analysis using SQL


🧭 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform insightful analysis on a sales dataset using SQL queries. This includes identifying key sales patterns, customer behavior, and high-performing products and regions to inform business decisions.
🛠️ Tools Used

   - MySQL (or any compatible SQL engine)

   - SQL for querying and data manipulation

   - Dataset stored in a table named company.sales

🧩 Steps Included

- Load the sales data into the database.

- Use SQL SELECT queries to explore and filter the data.

- Apply aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) and filtering clauses (WHERE, LIKE).

- Use GROUP BY and ORDER BY to derive insights.

- Apply ranking functions such as RANK() to evaluate product performance.

📈 Analysis Included

- Identify high-value orders shipped using 'Economy' mode.

- Extract sales data for the 'Technology' category in Ireland post-2020.

- List the top 10 most profitable transactions.

- Filter customer names by pattern matching (starts with 'J', ends with 'n').

- Search product names that contain the keyword 'Acco'.

- Determine top 5 cities based on total sales.

- Use pagination to display customer sales data.

- Calculate overall revenue, average unit cost, and total orders.

- Count unique regions from the dataset.

- Find the number of orders per customer.

- Rank products based on total sales.

🔍 Key Insights

- A subset of customers prefer Economy shipping even for high-value purchases.

- 'Technology' sales in Ireland show notable activity post-2020.

- Certain cities contribute significantly more to total revenue.

- Products with ‘Acco’ in their name are present and searchable.

- Top customers and top products can be ranked for targeted marketing.

✅ Conclusion

This SQL-based sales analysis demonstrates how structured queries can efficiently extract, summarize, and interpret business-critical data from a relational database. It sets a foundation for further business intelligence or dashboard development using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
